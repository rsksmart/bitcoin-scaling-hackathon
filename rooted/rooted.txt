# Rooted

Rooted is a non-custodial solution that uses stealth addresses which will allow users to receive funds on Rootstock Blockchain without revealing receivers real address.


### üìù Project Description

#### ‚úç Project Overview
- Rooted is a privacy-focused solution addressing the need for anonymity in blockchain transactions. It tackles the risk of exposing the identities and financial information of users by enabling anonymous transactions on the Rootstock Blockchain. The solution utilizes stealth addresses on the Rootstock Blockchain, allowing users to receive funds without revealing their real addresses.
- The project draws inspiration from existing privacy-focused blockchains like Monero and tools like Tornado Cash, but aims to bridge the gap between complex and expensive privacy solutions and non-private transfers.
- It empowers users to maintain their privacy, fostering trust and security in the blockchain industry.
- Overall, Rooted has the potential to become a leading privacy solution, ensuring the confidentiality and anonymity of blockchain transactions.

#### üòé Idea
- I've always been fascinated by the concept of anonymity in blockchains, with various methods available to achieve it.
- Privacy-focused blockchains like Monero and widely-used networks like Tornado Cash, which is based on anonymity sets or zero-knowledge proof solutions, provide near-perfect privacy for both parties in a transaction.
- However, they require specialized tools or come at a higher cost than direct transfers, leaving a gap between expensive, complex solutions and non-private transfers.
- Recently, Vitalik published an article titled "An Incomplete Guide to Stealth Addresses," which provided missing pieces of a simple yet effective solution for anonymous transactions, at least for the receiving party.
- Inspired by this idea we decided to create a user-friendly tool utilizing stealth addresses. We chose Rootstock as the initial network for its implementation due to its fast and affordable transactions.
- The name Rooted is chosen as users will be rooted in such a way that they will become anonymous while doing transactions üòé.

#### üì∫ Background & Context
- The problem that Rooted is tackling is the lack of privacy in blockchain transactions. While blockchain technology offers transparency and immutability, it also exposes transaction details, including sender and receiver addresses. This lack of privacy poses risks for individuals and businesses, as their financial activities can be tracked and potentially linked to their real-world identities.

- Privacy is a fundamental aspect of financial transactions. Without privacy, users are susceptible to various risks, including:

    - Identity exposure: When transactions are conducted openly on a blockchain, it becomes possible for observers to connect transactions with specific individuals or businesses. This can lead to the loss of financial privacy and potential targeting or surveillance.
 
    - Financial profiling: Analyzing blockchain transactions can enable third parties to build detailed profiles of individuals and businesses, including their spending habits, income, and financial relationships. This information can be used for targeted advertising, discrimination, or even extortion.

    - Security vulnerabilities: Repeatedly using the same address for receiving funds on a transparent blockchain can make users vulnerable to hacking or phishing attacks. Attackers can analyze transaction history to identify patterns, monitor account balances, and exploit weaknesses in security.

    - Business competition: Companies conducting transparent transactions may inadvertently reveal sensitive financial information, such as sales volume, supply chain relationships, or partnerships. Competitors could exploit this information for their advantage, compromising the competitiveness of businesses.

    - Compliance concerns: Certain industries, such as healthcare or finance, require strict privacy regulations. Transparent blockchain transactions may conflict with these regulations, leading to legal issues or non-compliance penalties.

- The importance of tackling this problem lies in the preservation of financial privacy and the protection of individuals' and businesses' sensitive information. By offering a user-friendly solution for anonymous transactions through stealth addresses, Rooted aims to empower users with greater control over their financial privacy and mitigate the risks associated with identity exposure.

#### ‚òÑÔ∏è Value Proposition

The generation and usage of Rooted IDs and stealth addresses are designed to be simple and intuitive, enabling a wide range of users to adopt and utilize the solution without technical complexity.

- Affordability and Speed: Rooted is built on the Rootstock Blockchain, chosen for its fast and affordable transactions. By leveraging this blockchain, Rooted offers users the benefits of privacy without sacrificing transaction speed or incurring high fees commonly associated with other privacy-focused solutions.

- Bridge the Gap: Rooted fills the gap between expensive and complex privacy solutions, such as Monero, and non-private transfers on transparent blockchains. It provides an intermediate solution that offers a significant level of privacy without the need for specialized tools or high costs.

- Wide Applicability: Rooted's privacy solution can be applied to various use cases. It can benefit individuals who want to keep their financial transactions private, businesses that need to protect their financial information, and anyone concerned about the risks associated with revealing their identity during transactions.

- Market Differentiation: Rooted stands out in the market by offering a unique approach to privacy in blockchain transactions. While other solutions rely on heavy computations or complex methodologies, Rooted simplifies the process with stealth addresses and Rooted IDs, making it more accessible and user-friendly.

#### ‚úí What it will do or Technical Description
- Stealth Addresses: Rooted utilizes stealth addresses, which are derived from elliptic curve key pairs. The public part of the key pair serves as the Rooted ID, a meta-address not tied to any actual blockchain address. This Rooted ID is shared by users to receive funds without revealing their real addresses.

- Rooted ID Generation: Users can generate multiple Rooted IDs, storing the key for future use. This allows them to have different Rooted IDs for different transactions or purposes, enhancing privacy. The generation process follows the principles outlined in Vitalik's article on stealth addresses.

- Transaction Process: When a user wants to send funds to a recipient, the sender calculates a stealth address using the recipient's Rooted ID and an ephemeral private key. This creates a new and unpredictable stealth address for each transfer. The sender then initiates a transaction to the Registry contract on the Rootstock Blockchain.

- Registry Contract: The Registry contract is an essential component of Rooted. It facilitates the transfer of funds to stealth addresses. The sender includes their ephemeral public key in the transaction, and the contract handles the transfer of funds to the calculated stealth address.

- Receiver Monitoring: The recipient, using their Rooted ID's private part, monitors the Registry contract for new keys published by senders. They attempt to construct a private key and corresponding stealth address using their Rooted ID. If the derived stealth address contains funds, it indicates that it is the stealth address where the funds were sent.

- Funds Withdrawal: Once the recipient identifies the stealth address with funds, they obtain the corresponding private key. This key can be used in any wallet software or to transfer funds directly from the Rooted website to another party, exchange, or cold wallet. By not withdrawing funds to a personal address, the connection between the recipient and sender remains hidden.

- RIF Technologies: Rooted leverages the capabilities of the Rootstock Infrastructure Framework (RIF) technologies. This includes the use of the Rootstock Blockchain, which offers fast and affordable transactions suitable for implementing the privacy features of Rooted.

- Addressing Privacy Concerns: Rooted addresses the problem of privacy in blockchain transactions by providing a user-friendly solution that allows individuals and businesses to receive funds without revealing their real addresses. By utilizing stealth addresses and Rooted IDs, Rooted ensures that transaction details remain private and reduces the risk of identity exposure and financial profiling.
