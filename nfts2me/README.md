# NFTs2Me - Empowering NFT creators on Rootstock

The Future of NFTs: Unlocking the Power of ERC-20 on Bitcoin with Rootstock

## Introduction:

As we step into the future of blockchain technology, the potential of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) continues to captivate creators and enthusiasts worldwide. However, the current landscape on Bitcoin is limited, lacking the robustness and versatility found in the Ethereum ecosystem. At NFTs2Me, we envision a groundbreaking solution that combines the power of ERC-20 with the proof-of-work security of the Bitcoin network.

## The Limitations of Decaffeinated NFTs on Bitcoin:

Ordinals (which may be seen as decaffeinated NFTs) have made strides in bringing NFT functionality to the Bitcoin network. However, we recognize that their current capabilities fall short of what is possible on Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. While "Ordinals" provide unique ownership representation and transferability, they lack the advanced features and smart contract functionalities that have propelled ERC-20 NFTs to new heights. To truly unlock the power of NFTs on Bitcoin, we must bridge this gap and create a platform that combines the best of both worlds.

## Empowering NFTs on Bitcoin with ERC-20 Compatibility:

At NFTs2Me, we aim to revolutionize the NFT landscape on Bitcoin by leveraging on the strengths of Rootstock. We can provide creators and collectors with a powerful and secure platform to unleash the full potential of their NFTs.

## Transforming the NFT Landscape on Bitcoin:

With NFTs2Me, we envision a future where NFTs on Bitcoin via Rootstock become synonymous with innovation and limitless possibilities. They will have the ability to define custom royalties, creating their own minting pages, use on-chain affiliation, integrate with DeFi protocols, and much more.

We aim to empower creators and enthusiasts to unleash the full potential of NFTs and not only limited ordinals.
  
## What is NFTs2Me?

**[NFTs2Me](https://nfts2me.com/)** is a user-friendly comprehensive platform to create, deploy and manage your NFT collection and community, **100% free** with advanced functionalities. It embraces the three big pillars of the NFT life cycle: creation, deployment, and administration of the contract and the community, empowering NFT creators.

The **creation** pillar allows users to create their own NFTs artwork using a simple and user-friendly interface. Users can upload their own artwork or other digital assets or use our builtin generative art tool, and we'll guide them through the process of creating the metadata, defining its rarity, and uploading the collection to IPFS (a decentralized immutable file system) for free.

The **deployment** pillar allows users to create and deploy the NFT contract on the blockchain, making them immutable, verified and accessible to the public. Our optimized system offers ultra low contract deployment fees while keeping advanced functionalities, like different minting types, minting the NFTs on any ERC-20 (like peggy BTC, USDT, DAI, ETH or any created ERC-20) or native coin (TZBC), Soulbound tokens, on chain affiliation... Furthermore, we offer the possibility to use our upgradeable contracts to benefit from new upcoming features. When deploying a collection you'll receive an NFT that represents its ownership.

The **administration** pillar focuses on the management of collection including the community aspect of the life cycle. Create custom subdomains or minting widgets for your own website, allowlists, whitelists, airdrops, set the drop and end date, create token gated content only accessible for your owners.

## Rootstock Direct Links

NFTs2Me is deployed right now only on Rootstock Testnet. When going to [https://nfts2me.com/app/rootstock-testnet/](https://nfts2me.com/app/rootstock-testnet/), it will ask you to swap the current connected network to Rootstock if you are not already connected, and also add the network if you don't have it already added.



## What makes NFTs2Me different?

Let's talk about some of this fantastic features that make NFTs2Me different.


### Ways to create a new NFT Project

Three types are available to make it easier for users to deploy an NFT project:

 - **Editions (1 artwork – multiple NFTs)**: The easiest way to get started. With Editions, you can create an NFT collection where all NFTs share the same artwork. If you don’t have artwork yet, you can even use Artificial Intelligence to create it.
 - **Drops (n artworks – n NFTs)**: If you already have specific images for each NFT, Drops allows you to assign different images to each NFT.
 - **Generative Art (combination of artworks)**: This is the advanced mode. Using the Generative Art editor, you can combine image layers (even using PSD files) to generate thousands of unique NFTs.



### Artificial Intelligence to create NFTs

Would you like to create a collection but don't have the artwork? We got you covered! Just a few words to create the artwork of your NFTs as well as the description using AI.

### Anypayments & ERC-20 mintings

NFTs2Me allows to set the minting price not only in native, but also in any currency/ERC-20, and let the users mint in ERC-20 or native coin. Set a price in Native Coin (e.g. TZBC) or ERC-20 (USDT, pegged BTC...). 

This is currently not live on Rootstock testnet, but will be on Rootstock mainnet. On mainnet it will let your users **mint your NFTs with anything** (Native or any ERC-20). We'll do a **transparent swap and mint** for the user in one transaction. The owner always receives in the defined payment.


### Collections as NFTs (Ownership)

When a new collection is deployed on the Blockchain, the owner will receive an NFT indicating its ownership of the deployed collection. The owner of the NFT will be the **owner of the collection**. Therefore, if you'd like to transfer the ownership of the collection, you'd just have to transfer the NFT to the new owner.

> The collection ownership is determined by an NFT we mint for you once you mint the collection. To transfer the ownership of the collection is as simple as transferring your ownership NFT.

When selling your collection you are selling the ownership as well as the owner's revenue (including secondary sales). **Just think about it and how powerful this is!**. The user is free to keep it or sell it (for instance, on OpenSea).

### Different minting types

**Sequential**, **Random** or **Specify minting** allow you to choose the minting behaviour on your collection. Over that, you can use a **Placeholder** to hide the actual metadata until you decide to reveal and fix on the blockchain.

> Minting Types are compatible with Placeholder. For instance, you can use Sequential Minting along with Placeholder to temporarily hide the metadata, and reveal at a later time.

-  **SEQUENTIAL MINTING**. It describe itself.

-  **SPECIFY MINTING**. Let your users decide their tokens.

-  **RANDOM MINTING**. Truly on-chain two-steps secure random minting.

  
### On-chain affiliation

Our on-chain affiliate system allows to reward both affiliates who help you sell the collection, as well as offer an optional discount for the end user coming from a affiliate link.

The **optional discount** is a great way to help promote your collection through affiliates, as these ensure that their audience will want to use their reference.

> You can choose to set a **general affiliation information** (commission and user discount), but you can also set a different and **custom per wallet affiliation information** (commission and user discount). That way, you can provide special commission conditions for top affiliates.

### Token Gating

Token gating is **a common tool used by NFT project teams to create value for community members**. Essentially, token gating allows projects to reward people who hold their NFTs by creating exclusive content, events, and other benefits available only to token holders.

Using our tools you'll be able to natively let your users (owner of NFTs from your collection) access exclusive content, exclusive Airdrops, ...

  
### Custom minting pages with free subdomain

Set up a **custom mint page** with your own subdomain to mint your NFTs or embed it in your website easily using our widget. You'll be able to set your own **custom subdomain** hosted by us or use you own website/domain.


### And much more!

Free IPFS-hosting, soulbound tokens, NFT holder snapshots, automatic logo and banner generation, split revenue, PSD support, airdrops with CSV batch sending, whitelisting, decentralized Governance and on-chain voting support, very gas efficient deployments...

## The future of NFTs2Me

During the Hackathon we've deployed our tool on Rootstock's testnet, so it can now be used to deploy NFTs projects on Rootstock Testnet's blockchain.

If we win the hackathon, we plan to **re-invest a part of the prize** to promote the **growth** and creation of NFT utility collections within the **Rootstock ecosystem** through:

* Quests/Competitions

* Direct rewards

* Raffles among creators

* Giving away our utility token (Booster Pack)

We want to continue building the most complete NFT toolkit for creators in the Rootstock ecosystem.
