This is our final submission for the hackathon.

First look at our video 'rsk-nostr.mp4'

Then read the 'hackathon_summary.pdf'.

As other deliverables we inclued our proof of concept smart contract and tests,
and our indexer for the nostr network which has been running for a while and has synced over 10M messages.
