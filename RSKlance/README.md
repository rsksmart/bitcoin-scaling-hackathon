# RSKlance: One-stop solution for all contract work, build on top of RootStock
## Project Overview & Summary
The freelance payment platform aims to provide a secure and transparent payment system for freelance developers. The platform leverages the Rootstock smart contract capabilities to automate and streamline the payment process based on task completion. This design document outlines the key components and functionalities of the system. Our project aims to develop a decentralized platform for project management and payment using smart contracts on the Rootstock (RSK) blockchain. The platform enables clients to post projects and developers to pick them up, ensuring secure and transparent payment releases based on task completion.


## Background & Context:
Here are some **common problems encountered by freelancers**:

- Irregular Income: Freelancers often experience irregular income streams, with some months being more profitable than others. This irregularity can make budgeting and financial planning challenging. It's crucial for freelancers to create a budget that accounts for fluctuations in income and establish an emergency fund to cover lean periods.

- Difficulty Setting Rates: Determining the appropriate rates for freelance services can be tricky. Freelancers need to consider factors such as their skills, experience, market demand, and the value they provide to clients. Setting rates too low can lead to financial struggles, while setting rates too high may deter potential clients. Finding the right balance is essential.

- Late or Non-Payment: Freelancers often face the problem of clients who pay late or fail to pay altogether. This can cause significant cash flow issues and affect the freelancer's ability to meet their financial obligations. Implementing clear payment terms, using contracts, and following up on unpaid invoices can help mitigate this problem.


## Value Proposition:
The freelance payment platform built on Rootstock can address some of the finance and tax-related challenges faced by freelancers. Here's how it can help **mitigate the mentioned problems**:

-  By automating the payment process based on task completion, the platform provides a more consistent and timely payment flow for freelancers. As tasks are completed and verified, payments are automatically released, reducing the impact of irregular income.

-  The platform's escrow functionality ensures that funds are held securely in smart contracts until tasks are successfully completed. This helps protect freelancers from non-payment or delayed payments. In case of payment disputes, the built-in dispute resolution mechanism provides a fair process for resolving conflicts and facilitating payment releases.

- The platform can integrate features to help freelancers track and manage their expenses. For example, it can provide tools for recording and categorizing business expenses, generating expense reports, and offering insights into their financial health. This streamlines expense management and simplifies tax preparation.

### Pros of using the freelance payment platform:

1. Security and Transparency: The use of smart contracts and the Rootstock blockchain ensures enhanced security and transparency in payment transactions. Freelancers and clients can have confidence in the integrity of the payment process.

2. Automated Payments: The platform automates the payment process based on predefined task completion criteria. This reduces manual effort and eliminates the need for constant manual payment requests.

3. Escrow Functionality: The smart contracts hold funds in escrow until tasks are successfully completed, providing protection to both freelancers and clients. This mitigates the risk of non-payment or incomplete work.

4. Dispute Resolution: The platform includes a dispute resolution mechanism that can help resolve conflicts between freelancers and clients in a fair and transparent manner. This ensures a smooth resolution process in case of disagreements.

5. Integration with Rootstock: Leveraging the Rootstock blockchain allows for compatibility with the Bitcoin ecosystem. Freelancers can benefit from the security and reliability of the Bitcoin network while utilizing smart contracts for payment automation.



## Technical Description:
### 1. System Architecture:
The freelance payment platform consists of the following components:

- Frontend Interface: A user-friendly web or mobile interface that allows freelancers and clients to interact with the platform. It includes features such as task creation, task tracking, payment management, and dispute resolution.

- Smart Contract Layer: The Rootstock smart contracts will handle the payment logic and escrow functionality. This layer will enforce the predefined rules for task completion, payment release, and dispute resolution. It will interact with the blockchain and manage the financial transactions securely.

- Blockchain Integration: The platform will integrate with the Rootstock blockchain to leverage its security and immutability. All payment transactions, task details, and contract terms will be recorded on the blockchain.

- User Wallets: Each user (freelancer and client) will have a digital wallet associated with their account. The wallet will store their Rootstock addresses, manage funds, and facilitate payment transfers.

### 2. Platform Workflow:

Step 1: User Registration and Wallet Creation
- Users will register on the platform, providing necessary details and creating their digital wallets.
- Wallets will be associated with Rootstock addresses, allowing users to send and receive payments securely.

Step 2: Task Creation and Agreement
- Clients can create tasks with detailed descriptions, requirements, and budgets.
- Freelancers can browse available tasks and submit proposals.
- Upon agreement, the client and freelancer will define the task milestones, payment terms, and deadlines.

Step 3: Task Progress and Verification
- Freelancers will work on the assigned tasks and update their progress on the platform.
- Clients can track the task progress and request revisions if necessary.
- Once a milestone is completed, the freelancer will submit the task for verification.

Step 4: Payment Processing
- Smart contracts on Rootstock will verify the task completion based on predefined criteria (e.g., submission of deliverables, client approval, etc.).
- Upon successful verification, the contract will automatically release the payment from the client's wallet to the freelancer's wallet.

Step 5: Dispute Resolution
- In case of disputes or conflicts, an arbitration process can be initiated.
- A designated arbitrator or a decentralized arbitration mechanism can review the case and make a fair judgment.
- The smart contract will execute the payment release according to the arbitration decision.

### 3. Security and Privacy Considerations:
- User authentication and access control mechanisms will be implemented to ensure platform security.
- Wallets will utilize secure key management practices and encryption to protect user funds.
- Personal information and transaction data will be handled in compliance with privacy regulations.

### 4. Integration and Scalability:
- The platform can integrate with popular payment gateways and financial services to facilitate fiat currency conversions.
- It should be designed to handle high transaction volumes and scalability to accommodate a growing user base.

### 5. Future Enhancements:
