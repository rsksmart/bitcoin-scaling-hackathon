## Project Summary
metaLuck is a groundbreaking saving protocol built on the RSK network, offering users the opportunity to save their assets and potentially earn rewards through weekly drawings. By leveraging Sovryn Lend, we utilize its interest generation mechanism to create a prize pool for the winners selected through the weekly drawings. With the implementation of the API3 QRNG for random number generation, metaLuck ensures a fair and transparent selection process. Our project aims to drive the adoption of the RSK network while providing users with an engaging and potentially rewarding savings experience.

This incentivizes users to save their assets into metaLuck instead of **keeping them idle or locked**. The integration with Sovryn Lend allows for interest generation from users' funds, which forms the prize pool for the weekly drawings.
