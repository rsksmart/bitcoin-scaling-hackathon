# Background & Context

The emergence of blockchain technology has paved the way for the rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), revolutionizing the way we perceive and exchange digital assets. NFTs enable the ownership and transfer of unique digital items, including artwork, music, collectibles, and virtual real estate, among others. This has created new opportunities for artists to showcase and monetize their creations in the digital realm.

However, the rapid growth of the NFT market has brought forth several challenges and issues that need to be addressed. The problem at hand lies in the unequal power dynamics, lack of transparency, and limited opportunities for artists within the existing NFT marketplace. These issues hinder the realization of the full potential of NFTs and their impact on the art and creative industries.

Firstly, artists often struggle to retain ownership and control over their digital artworks once they are sold as NFTs. The original creators often receive minimal or no royalties from subsequent resales, despite the increasing value of their artwork. This lack of compensation undermines the financial sustainability and recognition of artists, discouraging them from fully embracing the NFT space.

Secondly, the NFT marketplace is saturated with a vast array of artworks, making it challenging for artists to gain visibility and recognition for their creations. Without proper curation and personalized recommendations, unique and talented artists may go unnoticed, limiting their opportunities to showcase their work and connect with collectors and enthusiasts.

Furthermore, the existing NFT marketplace often lacks transparency and trust. Counterfeit artworks, unauthorized reproductions, and issues of provenance have plagued the space, undermining the credibility and authenticity of digital assets. This lack of transparency poses risks for both artists and collectors, hindering the growth and widespread adoption of NFTs.

The problem of empowering artists, ensuring fair compensation, fostering visibility, and establishing trust within the NFT marketplace is of utmost importance. Artists are the lifeblood of the creative industries, and their contributions should be recognized, valued, and adequately rewarded. By addressing these issues, we can create a more inclusive, sustainable, and vibrant ecosystem for artists, collectors, and enthusiasts in the digital art space.

It is essential to tackle these challenges to unlock the full potential of NFTs as a transformative force in the art world. By providing artists with ownership rights, fair compensation, visibility, and a secure platform for transactions, we can empower them to fully embrace the opportunities offered by the NFT marketplace. This will not only benefit individual artists but also foster creativity, diversity, and innovation in the broader art and creative industries.
