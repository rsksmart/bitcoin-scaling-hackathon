# Proposal: Advancing Accessibility of Bitcoin and Rootstock Networks

I submit a proposal to further advance the accessibility of the Bitcoin and Rootstock networks by introducing a Bitcoin-native InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD) based "internet" that integrates hyperexpressive smart contracts, interoperable electronic cash (ecash) protocols, and decentralized cloud computing capabilities. By combining these elements, we have the potential to build a powerful and versatile ecosystem that revolutionizes decentralized computing.

I believe that open collaboration and diverse perspectives are essential in exploring the possibilities of such a groundbreaking endeavor. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate your insights and feedback on the following key elements:

1. **Bitcoin-native IPLD "Internet":** Leveraging the power of IPLD, we can establish a decentralized and secure network that enables seamless data sharing and retrieval across different platforms and protocols. This Bitcoin-native IPLD "internet" could provide a foundation for a wide range of applications, fostering innovation and expanding possibilities within the Rootstock and Bitcoin ecosystems. Notably, IPLD heavily relies on CID (Content Identifier) content identification, empowering users to verify the veracity of any content they interact with or consume, ensuring integrity and trust within the network.

2. **Hyperexpressive Smart Contracts and Decentralized Cloud Computing:** Integrating hyperexpressive smart contracts with a proposed decentralized cloud computing module, powered by the IPVM execution layer, opens up new avenues for advanced programmability and automation. The decentralized cloud computing infrastructure utilizes the untapped computational resources of network participants, promoting scalability, privacy, and security. This integration unlocks new possibilities for decentralized application deployment, including decentralized AI and machine learning.

3. **Interoperability and Ecash Protocols:** The proposed system supports interoperability between BTC and Rootstock native assets such as DoC and DLLR, facilitating seamless value transfer and financial interactions within the ecosystem. The integration of electronic cash protocols enhances privacy, security, and transaction efficiency on the network.

I firmly believe that the implementation of a Bitcoin-native IPLD "internet" within the Rootstock and Bitcoin ecosystems could reshape decentralized computing and transform the way we interact with the internet. It has the potential to foster an ecosystem of decentralized applications, secure data storage, and efficient financial interactions. The applications are vast, ranging from decentralized document management and secure contract execution to collaborative file systems and decentralized AI.

Imagine a world where individuals can securely store their files, contacts, bookmarks, and even operating systems in an encrypted and decentralized manner. By inscribing UCAN-enabled WNFS (Web Native File System) strings to individual Sats on the Bitcoin mainchain, we can achieve this vision. The encrypted data can be backed up on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), providing decentralized storage persistence. The possibilities for enhanced privacy, data ownership, and seamless cross-border access become virtually limitless.

Moreover, this Bitcoin-native IPLD-based ecosystem opens up opportunities for innovative applications and services. For example, it becomes feasible to offer services akin to decentralized Dropbox, where families can distribute encrypted file systems across multiple Sats, granting each member access to a secure family file-sharing platform. Additionally, a decentralized website builder dApp can enable users to create fully functional static sites, with content control exclusively in the hands of the Sat-key holder, eliminating the need for intermediaries like DNS or KYC processes.

To realize this ambitious vision, it is crucial to explore partnerships with Protocol Labs and leverage their expertise in IPLD and related technologies. Collaboration would involve adopting and adapting the existing IPLD infrastructure to the Bitcoin ecosystem, specifically RSK. By working together, we can build a Bitcoin native IPLD-based internet layer, incorporating decentralized cloud computing and CPU rental services, all secured by the principles of Bitcoin's blockchain.
