Proposal outlining the Ignitus Project

Executive Summary

Ignitus Networks is planning to build a site for minting Soul Bound Tokens using the Rootstock ecosystem. This site will have features such as minting and transferring Soul Bound Tokens on Rootstock.  

Project Overview

Soul Bound Tokens are minted with the owner's and the creator's wallet addresses built-in to them and so they can only be transferred to the owner by the creator of the SBTs. These are suitable for issueing of certificates by educational institutions. 

Background & Context

NFTs are permanent records available on the Blockchain and so currently, educational institutions are offering their certificates as NFTs due to their immutability. However, NFTs are tradable in a marketplace and so ownership of an NFT does not confirm the certification of the present owner. 

Value Proposition

This product fixes the issue of transferrable NFTs as certificates. 
 
Technical Description

The smart contracts will be written in Solidity language. They will be deployed on the testnet and tested. The frontend will be built using ReactJS and will utilize many packages to support the marketplace. Ether.js/web3.js will be used to interact with the smart contracts deployed on chain and fetch the user's assets. 

Pinata-IPFS: The app will communicate with the IPFS network using plaintext HTTP to store NFT metadata on the IPFS network. The app will also use the HTTP protocol to communicate with the backend.


Market Analysis

This product is aimed at the institutional market where there is a need to issue immutable certificates with provenance.

Project Plan

The project will be developed in two phases. In the first phase, minting of SBTs will be done. In the second phase these minted SBTs will be transferred to the sole owner. 

Team & Resources

The team consists of four persons. Nandini and Gayatri are the software developers; Rakesh takes care of infrastructure and testing and Santhosh is the product manager. All have signed NDAs with Ignitus Networks. 

Conclusion

The standards of  Soul Bound Tokens are still evolving and so we are building our best guess of the standards. We will need to keep adapting this dapp as the standards evolve. Also, we are open to pivot our product based on the market demand.
