# RootSwap
A one point destination to swap your cryptos on Rootstock Blockchain.

### üìù Project Description

#### ‚úç Project Overview
- RootSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Rootstock Blockchain. It aims to provide users with complete control over their assets and transparent operations while enabling them to swap cryptocurrencies seamlessly. By forking UniswapV2 and deploying it on the Rootstock Blockchain, RootSwap allows users to exchange their cryptocurrencies while contributing to the development and improvement of the Rootstock ecosystem.
- Problem: Traditional banks have control over users' money, lacking transparency and the ability to withdraw funds in emergencies. Centralized exchanges also suffer from similar issues, reducing user control and transparency.
- Solution: RootSwap provides a decentralized alternative by leveraging blockchain technology. It allows users to swap cryptocurrencies directly on the Rootstock Blockchain, offering complete control and transparency over their assets.
- Potential Impact:
    - RootSwap empowers users by giving them full authority over their assets and promoting transparency. It eliminates the need for intermediaries and centralized control, offering a more inclusive and accessible platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies. By contributing fees to projects and the protocol's development, RootSwap supports the growth of the Rootstock ecosystem.
    - Additionally, users can earn RootSwap Tokens by providing liquidity, creating a passive income opportunity.

#### üì∫ Background & Context
- The problem RootSwap aims to address is the lack of control, transparency, and accessibility in the traditional banking system and centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. This problem is significant for several reasons:
    - Lack of Control: In the traditional banking system, individuals deposit their money with the expectation that they have control over it. However, banks have the ultimate authority and can restrict access to funds, impose limitations, or even refuse withdrawals in certain situations. This centralized control undermines individuals' financial autonomy and can lead to trust issues.

    - Lack of Transparency: Banks and centralized exchanges often lack transparency in their operations. Customers have limited visibility into how their funds are managed, the allocation of fees, or the overall financial health of the institution. This opacity can erode trust and create skepticism among users.

    - Centralized Points of Failure: Centralized exchanges act as intermediaries between users during cryptocurrency transactions. However, they are susceptible to hacking, technical failures, and even fraud. Incidents of exchange hacks and theft of user funds have occurred, resulting in significant financial losses for individuals.

    - Limited Accessibility: Traditional banking services and centralized exchanges may not be accessible to everyone, particularly in regions with underdeveloped financial infrastructure. This lack of accessibility hinders individuals' participation in the global financial system and restricts their ability to utilize cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange or investment.

- By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralization, RootSwap addresses these problems. It provides users with complete control over their assets, transparent operations recorded on the Rootstock blockchain, and eliminates the need for intermediaries. This ensures that users have direct ownership and authority over their funds, enhancing financial autonomy and trust.
- Moreover, RootSwap contributes to the development of the Rootstock ecosystem by allocating fees to projects and protocol improvements. This community-driven approach encourages innovation, fosters growth, and supports the broader adoption of decentralized technologies.

#### ‚òÑÔ∏è Value Proposition
- Complete Control: RootSwap empowers users by providing them with complete control over their assets. Unlike traditional banks and centralized exchanges, RootSwap operates on a decentralized platform where users have sole ownership and authority over their funds.

- Transparency: RootSwap leverages the transparency of blockchain technology to offer full visibility into the exchange operations. All transactions and smart contract interactions are recorded on the Rootstock blockchain, ensuring a transparent and auditable system thus eliminating doubts about hidden fees or manipulations.

- Decentralization and Security: RootSwap operates on the Rootstock Blockchain, a secure and robust blockchain infrastructure. By decentralizing the exchange process, RootSwap eliminates single points of failure and minimizes the risk of hacks, fraud, or technical glitches associated with centralized exchanges.

- Accessibility: RootSwap promotes financial inclusivity by providing a platform that is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Traditional banking services and centralized exchanges may have geographical restrictions or require extensive documentation. RootSwap removes these barriers and enables users from anywhere in the world to participate in cryptocurrency trading, fostering global economic participation.

- Contribution to the Rootstock Ecosystem: RootSwap goes beyond being just a decentralized exchange. It actively contributes to the development and growth of the Rootstock ecosystem. A portion of the fees generated by the exchange is allocated to projects being built on the Rootstock Blockchain, supporting innovation and expansion. This community-driven approach ensures that users' trading activities directly benefit the ecosystem they are a part of.

- Passive Income Opportunities: RootSwap provides users with the opportunity to earn passive income through liquidity provision. By adding liquidity to the exchange, users will be able to earn RootSwap(ROOTS) Tokens, creating a steady income stream. This incentivizes users to participate actively in the exchange, contributing to the liquidity and stability of the platform.

#### ‚úí Technical Description
- Forked UniswapV2: RootSwap will be built on a fork of UniswapV2, a popular decentralized exchange protocol. UniswapV2 provides the foundation for the exchange functionality, including token swapping and liquidity provision.

- Rootstock Blockchain: RootSwap operates on the Rootstock Blockchain, a smart contract platform based on the Bitcoin blockchain. Rootstock utilizes a merge-mining mechanism, securing transactions through the Bitcoin mining network while enabling smart contract functionality. This integration ensures a secure and robust environment for RootSwap's operations.

- Smart Contracts: RootSwap will deploy smart contracts on the Rootstock Blockchain to handle the core functionalities of the exchange. These smart contracts include the token swap mechanism, liquidity pool management, fee distribution, and user interactions.

- UI Integration: RootSwap will features its own user interface (UI) that interacts with the underlying smart contracts. The UI allows users to connect their wallets, view available tokens, execute token swaps, provide liquidity, and track their transactions and earnings.

- Fee Distribution: RootSwap introduces modifications to the UniswapV2 smart contracts to implement a fee distribution mechanism. A portion of the fees generated from the exchange transactions is allocated as follows: 0.01% to projects on the Rootstock Blockchain, 0.02% to protocol development and improvement and 0.3% to liquidity providers. This mechanism incentivizes users to participate in the exchange and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.

#### üíπ Market Analysis
- Growing Cryptocurrency Market: The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing rapid growth, with increasing adoption and interest from both individuals and institutional investors. The TAM for decentralized exchanges and blockchain-based financial services is expanding as more people seek alternatives to traditional banking and centralized exchanges.
