# Submission to Rootstock: Bitcoin Scaling Hackathon by Mintnite
Repository for "Rootstock: Bitcoin Scaling Hackathon" submissions

We’re sorry that our project is only partially open source, given that other similar projects are not open source either – Mintable, OpenSea, Rarible, MetaMask, Ledger and more.

The important aspect of our project to be open-source are the smart contracts. Thus, you may find them under mintnite folder.
