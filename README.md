**Project Overview:**

Tuki allows users to save in digital dollars (DOC) and spend in their local currency, bridging the gap between crypto and traditional financial systems. We started with 30 vendors and sole proprietors, 5 of whom continue to use us, and have integrated with popular software like Fudo and Suarmi. 

**Potential Impact:**

With 178 million Latinxs currently without debit cards, the potential market opportunity for Tuki is significant. By offering a secure and convenient modern financial service, we can help protect these individuals from inflation and create a more inclusive financial system.

**Background & Context:**

The genesis of Tuki was at Devcon Bogotá where Tule and Carlos met and bonded over a shared vision of financial inclusivity. Within two months, we had built and launched a crypto payment P2P application, which was the foundation of what Tuki is today.


**Value Proposition:**

Tuki provides an easy way to spend crypto in everyday life while safeguarding users from the harmful impacts of inflation. We achieve this by offering a seamless conversion of crypto to local currencies, with an easy-to-use interface and real-time notifications on WhatsApp.

**Technical Description:**

Tuki is an app built on a robust tech stack that includes blockchain for secure transactions, integrations with Fudo for restaurant payments, and Suarmi for converting crypto to local currency in Mexico. The debit cards are backed by Pomelo, a Banking as a Service platform in Latam. We plan to use RIF ecosystem to build a composable solution and explore integrate RSK as a Avalanche's subnet to increase the confirmation time of each transaction. 

**Market Analysis:**

The target market for Tuki is the 178 million Latinxs currently without debit cards. We're focusing initially on those already using crypto, intending to expand our reach as we grow. Our go-to-market strategy is to launch the cards at ETH Buenos Aires to gain immediate community feedback.

**Project Plan:**

Following our seed round, we plan to enhance our technical capabilities, expand our market reach, and develop more integrations with local and global financial tools. Our ultimate aim is to make Tuki the go-to financial solution for Latinxs.
