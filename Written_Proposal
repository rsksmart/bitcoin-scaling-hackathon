**Executive Summary**

Wooy is an innovative platform that is disrupting the traditional landscape of charitable fundraising. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology and RSK's infrastructure, Wooy introduces Proof of Donation NFTs (PODs) to incentivize companies and individuals to make a social impact. Our solution not only enhances brand reputation but also attracts new customers and optimizes corporate social responsibility (CSR) budgets, improving their ESG performance.

Through our platform, NGOs and streamers gain access to a wider donor base, collaborative opportunities, and improved donor engagement. Users, on the other hand, benefit from enhanced transparency, a unique digital impact identity, collectible NFTs, and exclusive perks.

Wooy empowers businesses, NGOs, streamers, and users alike to drive meaningful social and environmental change. With our innovative approach, we are revolutionizing the way charitable fundraising is conducted, making it more efficient, transparent, and rewarding for all stakeholders involved.

**Project Overview:**

Wooy is a platform that incentivizes companies and users to generate social impact. Through Proof of Donation NFTs (PODs), companies can enhance their brand image, acquire new customers, and creatively utilize CSR budgets. NGOs and streamers benefit from donor acquisition, collaboration opportunities, and enhanced interactions with donors. Users enjoy increased transparency, a digital impact identity, collectible NFTs, social sharing, and exclusive benefits. Wooy's platform empowers users, differentiates businesses, and facilitates positive change.

The traditional charitable fundraising model is outdated and inefficient, hindering nonprofits' ability to scale their efforts. Limited investments in marketing, technology, and talent restrict their fundraising potential. The urgent need to invest in nature, as highlighted by the UNEP, is impeded by these fundraising limitations. Additionally, shifting consumer attitudes towards sustainability place increasing pressure on companies to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable practices or risk reputational damage and loss of market relevance.

**Potential impact:**

Wooy has the potential to revolutionize the landscape of charitable fundraising by addressing the inefficiencies of the traditional model. By providing a simple and elegant solution through the use of Proof of Donation NFTs (PODs), Wooy offers a range of benefits for companies, NGOs, streamers, and individual users.

For companies, Wooy enables strategic utilization of corporate social responsibility (CSR) budgets, supporting innovative marketing campaigns that contribute to impactful causes. This not only enhances their brand image but also attracts new customers and fosters loyalty among existing ones. By establishing an impact identity, companies can showcase their commitment to social and environmental causes, building trust and aligning their brand with a purpose-driven mission.

NGOs and streamers can leverage Wooy's platform to acquire and retain donors, access new donor segments, and collaborate with companies for joint campaigns. The use of PODs creates a sense of community among donors, enhancing interactions and fostering long-term relationships. With increased transparency and traceability, donors gain confidence in their contributions, while the digital impact identity showcases their philanthropic endeavors.

Individual users benefit from Wooy's rewarding experience, with increased transparency, a digital impact identity, and an exclusive collectible NFT as tokens of appreciation. By sharing their Proof of Donation (POD) on social media, users inspire others to join the movement and create a positive ripple effect. Access to exclusive benefits further motivates their engagement in impact activities.

By addressing the limitations of traditional fundraising, Wooy has the potential to drive significant and differentiated results. It empowers businesses to combine innovative impact and marketing strategies, attract new customers aligned with their values, and enhance their brand reputation. Additionally, it facilitates increased investments in nature and supports the shifting consumer expectations towards sustainability. Overall, Wooy has the potential to make a meaningful impact in driving positive social and environmental change.

Additionally, for Rootstock we hold the potential for substantial impact through our unique features. Firstly, the platform can facilitate the creation of numerous purposeful tokens (PODs), opening doors to tokenizing various assets and concepts for innovative use cases. Additionally, we have the capacity to onboard and engage thousands of new users, fostering a dynamic and thriving ecosystem. This user growth strengthens the network effect, driving the adoption and utilization of Rootstock. Furthermore, by being an early adopter and pioneer in non-fungible token (NFT) use cases, we can use Rootstock to demonstrate the practical applications and advantages of this technology, bolstering its reputation and raising awareness. Overall, Wooy’s ability to generate PODs, attract a significant user base, and lead in NFT innovation positions us as a platform with the potential for substantial impact within the Rootstock ecosystem.

**Background & Context:**

The traditional charitable fundraising model is considered outdated and inefficient. Nonprofits often struggle to invest in marketing, technology, and top talent, which limits their ability to scale their fundraising efforts. Instead, they rely on expensive galas and outdated methods that are not easily scalable and heavily depend on human resources to grow.

Meanwhile, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has emphasized the need to significantly increase investments in nature by 2030. This course correction is essential to address pressing environmental challenges. However, the current fundraising limitations hinder nonprofits from making the necessary investments to drive meaningful change.

Furthermore, consumer attitudes and expectations have shifted towards sustainability. Approximately 50% of consumers now prioritize sustainability as one of their top five value drivers. Additionally, around 85% of consumers have become more environmentally conscious in their purchasing decisions in recent years.

As sustainability expectations rise, companies will face increasing pressure to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable practices. They must integrate sustainability into their value proposition to maintain their reputation and market share. Companies that neglect sustainability as a core value are at risk of future reputational damage and potential loss of market relevance.

**Value Proposition:**

Wooy is creating infraestructure that facilitates and incentivizes companies and users to generate impact.

We are creating a simple but elegant solution where from a concept that is the proof of donation NFT or as we called it PODs we can provide different benefits for everyone involved. (The PODs are certificates registered in blockchain for every donation made)

For Companies:

Our solution offers significant value to companies by leveraging the use of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) budgets in a strategic and impactful way. The value proposition for companies:

1. Innovative Marketing Campaigns: We enable companies to create innovative marketing campaigns that contribute to impactful causes. By allocating their CSR budgets towards these campaigns, companies can simultaneously enhance their brand image and make a positive social impact. This unique approach sets us apart from competitors and resonates with socially conscious consumers.
2. Acquiring New Customers: Companies have the opportunity to organize or sponsor campaigns that showcase their support for charitable causes. This not only helps them attract new customers who align with their values but also fosters loyalty among existing customers who appreciate the company's commitment to social responsibility. It serves as a powerful driver for customer acquisition and retention.
3. Creating an Impact Identity: By participating in our solution, companies can establish and showcase their impact identity. They can demonstrate to stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors, their commitment to social and environmental causes. This strengthens their reputation, builds trust, and aligns their brand with a purpose-driven mission.

For NGOs and Streamers:

NGOs and streamers play a crucial role in our solution, and they can enjoy several benefits from using our platform. The value proposition for NGOs and Streamers:

1. Donor Acquisition and Retention: Our platform provides incredible opportunities for NGOs and streamers to acquire and retain donors. The distribution of Proof of Donation NFTs (PODs) creates a sense of community and belonging among donors, fostering long-term relationships. This helps in sustaining and expanding their support base.
2. Access to New Donors and Segments: By utilizing PODs, NGOs and streamers can reach new segments they previously may not have reached, such as streamers' audiences and younger demographics. This allows them to diversify their donor pool and expand their impact.
3. Collaboration Opportunities with Companies: Our platform creates opportunities for NGOs and streamers to collaborate with companies for joint campaigns. This collaboration not only increases their visibility but also provides additional resources and expertise. It allows them to amplify their message, attract more support, and generate mutually beneficial outcomes.
4. Enhanced Interactions with Donors: The use of technology, such as our PODs, provides NGOs and streamers with new ways to interact with their donors. They can utilize these digital assets to engage and communicate with their donor community more effectively. It enhances transparency, fosters trust, and deepens the connection between donors and the causes they support.

For Users:

Our platform focuses on providing a rewarding experience for individual users who want to make a difference through their donations. The value proposition for users:

1. Increased Transparency and Traceability: We enhance the transparency and traceability of users' donations. Through our platform, users can have a clear understanding of where their donations go and how they are utilized by the charitable organizations they support. This transparency gives users confidence that their contributions are making a real impact.
2. Digital Impact Identity: We generate a digital impact identity for users, showcasing all the causes they have supported. Users can view a comprehensive record of their philanthropic endeavors, allowing them to take pride in their contributions and see the collective difference they have made. This digital identity serves as a testament to their commitment to social good.
3. Exclusive Collectible NFT: As a token of appreciation, we offer users their first collectible NFT, specially designed to enhance interaction with the donor. This unique digital asset represents their support for charitable causes and serves as a tangible reminder of their generosity. Users can engage with their NFT and explore additional content related to the causes they care about.
4. Social Sharing and Community Engagement: Users can share their Proof of Donation (POD) on social media platforms and proudly display their support for causes they believe in. By showcasing their philanthropic activities, they inspire others to join the movement and create a positive ripple effect. Additionally, users can connect with like-minded individuals within our community, fostering a sense of belonging and collective impact.
5. Access to Exclusive Benefits: Users gain access to a range of exclusive benefits, including discounts, prizes, and community-exclusive perks. These incentives are designed to reward users for their contributions and further motivate their engagement with charitable activities. It adds an extra layer of value to their involvement and encourages ongoing support.

Overall, our platform empowers users to make a tangible impact, amplifies their voice in social causes, and rewards their philanthropic efforts with a sense of community, digital collectibles, and exclusive benefits.

Our value proposition centers around the fusion of creativity and analysis, working closely with businesses to create campaigns that generate significant and differentiated results in the market. We offer a forward-thinking solution that not only benefits businesses but also facilitates positive social and environmental change.

**Technical Description:**

On this stage we are focusing on giving the Proof of Donation tool to every NGO, streamer or anyone generating impact to reward those who help them. This first stage we are using NFTs as the way of providing that certificate of the donation made and creating the first impact identity for users and companies. By doing this we are creating an excellent way to onboard new users into the blockchain scenery and specifically to Rootstock because most of our user/donors are non-blockchain users.

On our second stage we will implement further data into these NFTs by creating databases partly on chain and partly off-chain (for data privacy) with Cedalio. In this stage we will start providing further transparency and data reporting for the NGOs and their stakeholders.

Lastly we will create liquidity pools to allow users to generate donations for free. This product is already developed (on Polygon) and works as a liquidity pool where users can deposit and withdraw whenever they want, but while their funds are deposited they generate yield in lending protocols (for Rootstock they would be Tropykus and Soveryn) which later is donated to the NGO.

Key Features and Functionalities:

1. Proof of Donation NFTs: We utilize non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a way to provide certificates of donations made by users. Each donation is recorded on the blockchain as a unique NFT, ensuring immutability and transparency. These NFTs serve as proof of the user's impact and can be collected and showcased by the donors.
2. Creating Impact Identity: Through RIF Identity Manager, we enable users to create and manage their digital identity. This identity represents their impact on various causes they have supported. By leveraging RIF Identity Manager, we ensure the security and privacy of user data while providing a seamless experience for users to control and access their identity.
3. Data Management with Cedalio: In the second stage of our project, we integrate Cedalio, a solution for on-chain and off-chain data management. We utilize Cedalio's capabilities to create databases that store additional information related to the donations made. This data can be securely managed on-chain and shared with relevant stakeholders, providing increased transparency and reporting for NGOs and their supporters.
4. Liquidity Pools for Donations: In the final stage of our project, we implement liquidity pools where users can deposit their funds. These pools, already developed on other networks (Polygon), enable users to generate yield through lending protocols (such as Tropykus and Soveryn on Rootstock). The generated yield is then donated to the NGO, allowing users to contribute to causes without incurring additional costs.

Overall, our solution addresses the problem of outdated and inefficient fundraising models by leveraging RSK's infrastructure, NFTs, RIF Identity Manager, and Cedalio. We provide a user-friendly platform that enables NGOs, streamers, and other impact generators to reward their donors, create an impact identity, ensure transparency in donations, and facilitate user engagement with blockchain technology. By integrating various RIF technologies, we enhance the functionality, security, and scalability of our solution, while also onboarding non-blockchain users to the Rootstock ecosystem.

**Market Analysis:**

Our solution addresses a significant market opportunity by combining two key trends in the industry. Firstly, there is a current shift towards real-world use cases of blockchain technology, moving away from speculation. This aligns with our approach of providing tangible solutions that leverage the benefits of blockchain. Secondly, there is a growing pressure on businesses to engage in impactful campaigns and demonstrate corporate responsibility. This presents an opportunity for us to offer a comprehensive solution that combines impact-driven campaigns with marketing strategies, enabling businesses to meet these increasing demands effectively.

In terms of market size, our solution targets multiple markets. Firstly, the crypto market represents a substantial opportunity, as we provide users who hold cryptocurrencies with a way to generate value from their holdings, which often remain idle in wallets. This market is already valued in the trillions and continues to grow exponentially.

Additionally, the donations market is another key segment we target. In the United States alone, the donations market is valued at 470 billion annually. With the increasing demand for transparent and rewarding donation experiences, our solution is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this market.

By positioning ourselves between these multiple markets, including the charitable, events, and DeFi sectors, we tap into a vast total addressable market (TAM). This allows us to reach a wide range of users and businesses seeking efficient and rewarding ways to donate, participate in events, and engage with blockchain technology. As these markets continue to grow and evolve, our solution has the potential for substantial market penetration and long-term success.

**Project Plan:**

To bring our idea to market, we have developed a launch strategy focused on "invading" the market with PODs and gradually educating users. We will target three key segments: nonprofits, streamers, and charitable events, as effective channels for user acquisition. Additionally, we will create initial campaigns in collaboration with recognized brands to demonstrate the effectiveness of PODs. Our goal is to quickly attract users and raise awareness about the benefits of our solution. 

Here are the key steps of our strategy:

1. Market Segmentation: We will identify and focus on three key segments: nonprofits, influential streamers, and charitable event organizers. These sectors have a natural connection to our proposition and will serve as effective acquisition channels.
2. Strategic Partnerships: We will establish partnerships with nonprofits, influential streamers, and charitable event organizers. These collaborations will allow us to reach their followers and donors, leveraging their credibility and reach to promote the use of PODs.
3. Campaigns with Recognized Brands: To demonstrate the effectiveness of PODs, we will create initial campaigns in collaboration with recognized brands. These campaigns will serve as success stories and help raise awareness about the benefits of our solution among a wider audience.
4. Gradual Education: We will implement a gradual education strategy for users. We will start with a clear and simple introduction to how PODs work and how they can benefit donors. As users become familiar with the concept, we will provide more detailed information about the features and advantages of our solution.
5. Awareness Generation and User Acquisition: Through digital marketing campaigns, public relations efforts, and presence at relevant events, we will create awareness about our solution and quickly attract early users. We will utilize content strategies, social media, and collaborations to amplify our message and reach our target audience.
6. Iteration and Continuous Improvement: As we receive feedback from users and gain traction in the market, we will iterate and improve our solution based on user needs and preferences. We will stay attentive to growth opportunities and adapt our strategy accordingly.

By implementing this comprehensive strategy, we aim not only to attract users quickly but also to raise awareness and change the way people and businesses approach donations and social impact.
