Executive Summary:

Bitcoin ordinals are being traded at $9M a day! BendDAO is one of the biggest NFT lending platforms for lending on the Ethereum ecosystem. Holders of NFTs There lacks a platform to do it on the bitcoin network! 

Project Overview:

Our project aims to develop a liquidity pool lending protocol, similar to BendDAO, but uniquely tailored for Bitcoin Ordinals - a new class of digital assets that inscribes unique images onto Satoshis, mirroring the properties of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Leveraging the power of Rootstock, a smart contract platform connected to the Bitcoin blockchain, our protocol will provide a decentralized marketplace for lending and borrowing of Bitcoin Ordinals and other crypto-assets.

Solution:

The protocol will facilitate the staking of Bitcoin Ordinals, allowing users to borrow Bitcoin, and even buy NFTs at discounted rates while borrowing Ether (ETH). It will also create opportunities for users to bid on and purchase liquidated Bitcoin Ordinals, thus opening up a new market. For users with surplus Bitcoin, the protocol offers an avenue to supply their assets and earn attractive APR. The protocol will generate revenue for the platform through transaction fees and other potential financial mechanisms.

Potential Impact:

By creating a novel marketplace for the borrowing and lending of unique Bitcoin assets, our protocol has the potential to unlock significant value for users and stimulate new economic activity in the crypto space. It will provide a fresh avenue for individuals to leverage their Bitcoin holdings and participate in the rapidly growing NFT market, adding a unique layer to the broader DeFi ecosystem.

Background & Context:

NFTs have seen an exponential rise in popularity and have become a significant component of the blockchain industry. In parallel, Bitcoin, as the original and largest cryptocurrency, has a vast user base with significant potential to participate in the NFT-like space. Our solution seeks to merge these two streams, thus offering Bitcoin holders the ability to participate in the NFT trend.

Technical Description:

Our protocol leverages the power of Rootstock for smart contracts, Oracles for real-world data integration, and PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) to handle multi-signature transactions, crucial for handling P2P transactions and maintaining platform security on BTC as well as rootstock infrastructure like the Bitcoin to smart Bitcoin (rBTC) peg-in. To identify ordinals that are on rBTC, we will need to fork the ordinal protocol, make use of ordinal explorer APIs. 

Market Analysis:

Given the growing popularity of NFTs, coupled with the established user base of Bitcoin, we believe there is a substantial market for a Bitcoin-based NFT lending platform. Furthermore, the increased interest in DeFi lending solutions suggests a promising market environment for our protocol.

Project Plan:

Our project plan is divided into two main stages:

Launch MVP: We will develop and release a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to gain user feedback and make necessary improvements.

Official Launch: After successful testing and validation of the MVP, we plan to officially launch our protocol to all users.
