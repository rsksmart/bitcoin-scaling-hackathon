We’re sorry that our project is not open source, given that other similar projects are not open source either – Mintable, OpenSea, Rarible, Ledger (partial open) and more.

It seems unfair to use to open source our hard work at this moment when anyone can just copy it and create their own crypto credit card. We don’t raise money through tokens – no ICO, nothing.
